# Laravel REST API – Flutter Integration

[`laravel_rest_api_flutter`](https://pub.dev/packages/laravel_rest_api_flutter){:target="_blank"} is a Flutter package that simplifies interaction with a **Laravel REST API**.

[`Laravel REST API`](https://github.com/xefi/laravel-rest-api-flutter){:target="_blank"} is the backend package this Flutter client is designed to work with.

It provides:

- A standard **client interface** (`RestApiClient`) that you implement with your preferred HTTP library (e.g. `dio`).
- High-level factories for:
  - 🔍 **Search**
  - 🧬 **Mutations** (create / update)
  - 🗑️ **Delete**
  - ⚙️ **Custom actions**

This design helps you keep your integration:

- **Typed** — through your own models,
- **Testable** — through repositories and factories,
- **Consistent** — same patterns across all modules and projects.

Use this documentation to:

1. Install the package.
2. Configure your HTTP client.
3. Define models and repositories.
4. Use search, mutate, delete, and actions in your Flutter app.


## SDK Coverage & Recent Updates

The Flutter SDK provides a typed client for the Laravel Rest API (Lomkit),
covering all main resource interactions:

- Search (filters, scopes, includes, aggregates, instructions, pagination)
- Details (single resource retrieval with metadata and gates)
- Mutate (create/update with nested relation operations)
- Actions (custom resource actions)
- Delete / Restore / Force Delete lifecycle
- Gates & authorization metadata

### Recent improvements
- Fixed nested mutate relation serialization
- Correct pagination handling in search requests
- Instruction payload alignment with backend expectations
- Explicit null handling in filters and instruction fields
- Full test coverage across all factories

For detailed examples, refer to the dedicated documentation sections.
