# SDK Overview

This SDK is a thin, typed client for **Laravel Rest API (Lomkit)** resources.

You build a repository for a resource by mixing in the factories you need (Search, Details, Mutate, Actions, Delete…).
Each factory knows how to build the request body and which endpoint to call.

## Covered features

- **Search**: filters, scopes, sorts, selects, includes, aggregates, instructions, pagination
- **Details**: retrieve a single resource (optionally with includes / metadata)
- **Mutate**: create/update + nested relation operations (attach/detach/sync/toggle…)
- **Actions**: run server-side actions on resources
- **Delete lifecycle**: delete, restore, force delete
- **Gates**: parse authorization responses (boolean or `{ allowed, message }`)

> For full API concepts (Resources, scopes, instructions, gates), refer to the Lomkit docs.
